⚡ Testing Java Backend Without a Database? Here's How.

The Question:
"How do I test backend logic without spinning up PostgreSQL every time?" 🤔

I discovered: Unit Testing + Mockito = Test in isolation, no database needed!

Speed Comparison:
🐌 Manual testing (Postman): ~5 min per feature
🐌 Integration test: ~30s per test (needs PostgreSQL)
⚡ Unit test: ~36ms per test (mocked repository!)
📊 91 tests executed in just 3.3 seconds

What Got Tested (Without Database):
🔐 JWT token validation (15 tests)
⚙️ User CRUD operations (17 tests)
📁 File upload validation (21 tests)
🌐 REST API endpoints (38 tests)

Results After 4 Days:
✅ 91 unit tests implemented
✅ 100% pass rate (zero failures)
✅ 91% code coverage
✅ 3.3s total execution time
✅ No database dependency

Tech Stack:
• JUnit 5 - Testing framework
• Mockito - Mocking dependencies
• Spring Boot Test
• @TempDir for file testing

Key Takeaway:
Unit tests ≠ Replacement for integration tests
Unit tests = Fast feedback on logic
Integration tests = Verify connections work

From manual Postman testing to 91 automated tests in 4 days 🚀
