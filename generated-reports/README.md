# Generated Reports

This directory contains **auto-generated audit reports** from Claude validator agents.

## Purpose

Validator agents (`test-validator`, `docs-validator`, `plan-checker`) generate markdown reports here to document findings, issues, and recommendations.

## Report Types

### 1. Test Audit Reports

**Pattern:** `test-audit-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md`

Generated by: `test-validator` agent

**Contents:**
- E2E test coverage analysis
- Spec ↔ Playwright test synchronization
- Missing tests with criticality levels
- Flaky test detection
- Coverage metrics vs thresholds

**Example:**
```
test-audit-2026-01-08-1430.md
```

---

### 2. Documentation Audit Reports

**Pattern:** `docs-audit-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md`

Generated by: `docs-validator` agent

**Contents:**
- API endpoints documentation status
- JSDoc comment coverage
- Diátaxis categorization verification
- Broken links detection
- Documentation quality issues

**Example:**
```
docs-audit-2026-01-08-1445.md
```

---

### 3. Plan Audit Reports

**Pattern:** `plan-audit-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md`

Generated by: `plan-checker` agent

**Contents:**
- 4-document system verification
- Checklist completion status
- Acceptance criteria validation
- Task atomicity analysis
- Plan readiness assessment

**Example:**
```
plan-audit-2026-01-08-1500.md
```

## Usage

### Running Validators

Validators are triggered manually by invoking agents:

```bash
# Test validation
@test-validator

# Documentation validation
@docs-validator

# Plan validation
@plan-checker
```

### Viewing Reports

Reports are markdown files, open with any text editor or markdown viewer:

```bash
# View latest test audit
cat generated-reports/test-audit-2026-01-08-1430.md

# View all reports
ls -lt generated-reports/*.md
```

---

## Gitignore

Auto-generated reports (*.md) are **gitignored** to avoid cluttering the repository. Only this README and `.gitkeep` are tracked.

**Exception:** If a report is particularly important (e.g., milestone audit), you can:
1. Rename it: `test-audit-milestone-v1.0.md`
2. Force add: `git add -f generated-reports/test-audit-milestone-v1.0.md`

---

## Retention

**Local Development:**
- Reports accumulate locally
- Clean up old reports periodically: `rm generated-reports/test-audit-2025-*.md`

**CI/CD:**
- Reports generated in CI are uploaded as artifacts
- Retention: 30 days (configurable in CI config)

---

## Report Analysis

### Finding Trends

Use reports to track quality trends over time:

```bash
# Count CRITICAL issues over time
grep -r "CRITICAL" generated-reports/*.md | wc -l

# Find all flaky tests across reports
grep -r "Flaky" generated-reports/test-audit-*.md
```

### Metrics Tracking

Extract metrics for dashboards:

```bash
# Total issues per report
grep "Total Issues:" generated-reports/*.md
```
