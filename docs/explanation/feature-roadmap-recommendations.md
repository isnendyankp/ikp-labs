## Feature Recommendations by Tier

### TIER 1: Social Engagement Features

These features build on existing CRUD knowledge while introducing social interaction patterns. **Best for immediate next steps.**

---

#### ~~Feature 1.1: Photo Likes & Favorites~~ ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

> **Status:** COMPLETED (March 2026)
> **Implementation:** See Phase 8: Social Engagement above

This feature has been successfully implemented with:
- Like/unlike functionality
- Favorite/unfavorite functionality
- Paginated liked/favorited photos pages
- Gallery sorting by likes/favorites
- Optimistic UI updates
- Composite unique constraints

**Next Step:** Consider Feature 1.2 (Comments) or Feature 1.3 (Search)

---

#### Feature 1.2: Photo Comments System 💬

**Problem Statement:**
Users can view photos but cannot provide feedback, ask questions, or engage in discussions. This limits community building and photo owner engagement.

**Proposed Solution:**
Implement a threaded comment system with nested replies, enabling rich discussions around photos.

**Features:**
- ✅ Add comments to any public photo
- ✅ Reply to comments (threaded/nested comments)
- ✅ Edit/delete own comments
- ✅ Photo owner can delete any comment on their photos (moderation)
- ✅ Comment count per photo
- ✅ Sort comments (newest, oldest, most replied)
- ✅ Real-time comment notifications (optional: polling or WebSocket)

**Technical Breakdown:**

**Backend:**
- New entity: `PhotoComment` with self-referencing foreign key
- New repository: `PhotoCommentRepository`
- New endpoints:
  - `POST /api/gallery/photo/{photoId}/comments` - Add comment
  - `POST /api/gallery/comment/{commentId}/reply` - Reply to comment
  - `GET /api/gallery/photo/{photoId}/comments` - Get all comments (paginated, threaded)
  - `PUT /api/gallery/comment/{commentId}` - Edit comment
  - `DELETE /api/gallery/comment/{commentId}` - Delete comment
- Service layer: CommentService with recursive logic for nested comments

**Frontend:**
- New components: `CommentSection`, `Comment`, `CommentForm`, `ReplyButton`
- State management: Nested comment tree structure
- UI: Collapsible replies, indentation for threads
- Real-time: Polling for new comments (or WebSocket for advanced)

**Testing:**
- Unit tests: 15 new tests (CommentService, authorization logic)
- E2E tests: 12 scenarios (add, reply, edit, delete, moderation)
- Edge cases: Deeply nested comments, deleted parent comments

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE photo_comments (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    photo_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    parent_comment_id BIGINT, -- NULL for top-level comments
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (photo_id) REFERENCES gallery_photos(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (parent_comment_id) REFERENCES photo_comments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE INDEX idx_comments_photo_id ON photo_comments(photo_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_comments_parent_id ON photo_comments(parent_comment_id);
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Users can comment on public photos
- ✅ Nested replies work up to 5 levels deep
- ✅ Photo owner can moderate comments
- ✅ Comment count updates correctly
- ✅ No orphaned comments on deletion

**Effort Estimate:**
- **Complexity:** Medium-High
- **Time:** 2-3 weeks

- ✅ Search result highlighting
- ✅ Autocomplete suggestions (optional)
- ✅ Debounced search input (performance optimization)

**Technical Breakdown:**

**Backend:**

- Debouncing: 300ms delay before triggering search

**Testing:**
- Unit tests: 10 new tests (search queries, filter combinations)
- E2E tests: 8 scenarios (search, filter, sort, combined)
- Performance tests: Search with 1000+ photos

**Example Query:**
```java
@Query("SELECT p FROM GalleryPhoto p WHERE " +
       "(LOWER(p.title) LIKE LOWER(CONCAT('%', :query, '%')) OR " +
       "LOWER(p.description) LIKE LOWER(CONCAT('%', :query, '%'))) AND " +
       "p.uploadDate BETWEEN :from AND :to AND " +
       "p.isPublic = :isPublic " +
       "ORDER BY p.uploadDate DESC")
Page<GalleryPhoto> searchPhotos(@Param("query") String query,
                                  @Param("from") LocalDateTime from,
                                  @Param("to") LocalDateTime to,
                                  @Param("isPublic") Boolean isPublic,
                                  Pageable pageable);
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Search returns results in <500ms for 1000+ photos
- ✅ Filters can be combined (e.g., search + date range + user)
- ✅ Search highlights matching text
- ✅ URL reflects current search/filter state (shareable links)

**Effort Estimate:**
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Time:** 1-2 weeks
- **Dependencies:** Recommended after Likes/Comments for sorting by engagement

**Learning Outcomes:**
- ⭐⭐⭐ Full-text search implementation
- ⭐⭐⭐ Database query optimization
- ⭐⭐ Debouncing for performance

    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- PhotoTags junction table (Many-to-Many)
CREATE TABLE photo_tags (
    photo_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    tag_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (photo_id, tag_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (photo_id) REFERENCES gallery_photos(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (tag_id) REFERENCES tags(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Categories table
CREATE TABLE categories (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    description TEXT
);

-- Add category_id to gallery_photos

---

#### Feature 2.1: Photo Albums/Collections 📁

**Problem Statement:**
Users have many photos but no way to group them into collections (e.g., "Summer Vacation 2024", "Family Portraits"). This makes it hard to organize and share related photos.

**Proposed Solution:**
Implement a multi-photo album system with privacy controls and sharing capabilities.

**Features:**
- ✅ Create named albums (e.g., "Vacation 2024")
- ✅ Add/remove photos from albums
- ✅ Album cover photo selection
- ✅ Drag-and-drop photo reordering within album

**Frontend:**
- New components: `AlbumGrid`, `AlbumDetail`, `AlbumForm`, `PhotoReorderDnD`
- Drag-and-drop: `react-beautiful-dnd` library
- State management: Album state, photo order array

**Testing:**
- Unit tests: 16 new tests (AlbumService, authorization, ordering logic)
- E2E tests: 12 scenarios (CRUD albums, add/remove photos, reorder, privacy)

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE albums (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    cover_photo_id BIGINT,
    is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (cover_photo_id) REFERENCES gallery_photos(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

CREATE TABLE album_photos (
    album_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    photo_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    display_order INT NOT NULL,
    added_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (album_id, photo_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (album_id) REFERENCES albums(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (photo_id) REFERENCES gallery_photos(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Albums can contain multiple photos
- ✅ Photos can belong to multiple albums
- ✅ Drag-and-drop reordering works smoothly
- ✅ Album privacy is enforced
- ✅ Cover photo displays correctly

**Effort Estimate:**
- **Complexity:** High
- **Time:** 2-3 weeks
- **Dependencies:** Tags feature recommended first (albums + tags = powerful organization)

**Learning Outcomes:**
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Hierarchical data organization
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Drag-and-drop UI implementation
- ⭐⭐⭐ Ordering/sequencing logic
- ⭐⭐ Nested permissions (album + photo privacy)
- ⭐⭐ Many-to-Many with additional properties (display_order)

**Priority:** 🔶 **MEDIUM** - Powerful feature but requires Tags first for best UX

---

#### Feature 2.2: Advanced Search & Filtering Hub 🔎

**Problem Statement:**
After implementing tags and albums, search becomes more complex. Users need a unified search experience across all dimensions.

**Proposed Solution:**

**Frontend:**
- New components: `AdvancedSearchPanel`, `FacetFilters`, `SavedSearches`
- State management: Complex filter object with URL sync

**Effort Estimate:**
- **Complexity:** High
- **Time:** 2 weeks
- **Dependencies:** Requires Tags + Albums implemented first

**Learning Outcomes:**
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Complex database queries with multiple JOINs
- ⭐⭐⭐ Faceted search implementation
- ⭐⭐ Query builder patterns
- ⭐⭐ Search UX patterns

**Priority:** 🔶 **MEDIUM** - Enhances existing features, not critical initially
