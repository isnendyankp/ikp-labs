# How-To Guides

**Problem-solving guides** - Practical step-by-step guides to solve specific problems and accomplish specific tasks.

## What are How-To Guides?

How-to guides are goal-oriented directions that help you solve a specific problem or accomplish a specific task. Unlike tutorials (which are learning-focused), how-to guides assume you have basic knowledge and want to achieve a particular outcome.
