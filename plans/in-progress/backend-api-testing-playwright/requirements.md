## User Stories

### User Story 1: Automated Authentication Testing

**As a** backend developer
**I want** automated API tests for all authentication endpoints
**So that** I can verify authentication flows work correctly without manual Postman testing

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario 1: User registration with valid data**
```
Given the backend API is running on localhost:8081
When I send a POST request to /api/auth/register with valid user data
Then I should receive a 201 Created response
And the response should contain a valid JWT token
And the response should include user details (id, email, fullName)
```

**Scenario 2: Login with valid credentials**
```
Given a registered user exists in the database
When I send a POST request to /api/auth/login with correct email and password
Then I should receive a 200 OK response
And the response should contain a valid JWT token
And the token should be usable for protected endpoints
```

**Scenario 3: Token refresh with valid token**
```
Given I have a valid JWT token
When I send a POST request to /api/auth/refresh with the token
Then I should receive a 200 OK response
And the response should contain a new JWT token
```

### User Story 2: Automated User Management Testing

**As a** backend developer
**I want** automated API tests for user CRUD operations
**So that** I can ensure user management endpoints work correctly

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario 1: Create user via API**
```
Given I have valid user registration data
When I send a POST request to /api/users
Then I should receive a 201 Created response
And the response should contain the created user's details
And the user should exist in the database
```

**Scenario 2: Retrieve all users**
```
Given multiple users exist in the database
When I send a GET request to /api/users
Then I should receive a 200 OK response
And the response should contain a list of users
And each user should have id, email, and fullName fields
```

**Scenario 3: Update user by ID**
```
Given a user exists with a specific ID
When I send a PUT request to /api/users/{id} with updated data
Then I should receive a 200 OK response
And the response should contain the updated user details
```

### User Story 3: Protected Endpoint Authorization

**As a** backend developer
**I want** automated tests for JWT-protected endpoints
**So that** I can verify authentication and authorization work correctly

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario 1: Access protected endpoint with valid token**
```
Given I have a valid JWT token from login
When I send a GET request to /api/user/profile with Authorization header
Then I should receive a 200 OK response
And the response should contain my user profile data
```

**Scenario 2: Access protected endpoint without token**
```
Given I do not have an Authorization header
When I send a GET request to /api/user/profile
Then I should receive a 401 Unauthorized response
```

**Scenario 3: Access protected endpoint with expired token**
```
Given I have an expired JWT token
When I send a GET request to /api/user/profile with the expired token
Then I should receive a 401 Unauthorized response
```

### User Story 4: Error Handling Validation

**As a** backend developer
**I want** automated tests for error scenarios
**So that** I can verify the API handles errors gracefully

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario 1: Registration with duplicate email**
```
Given a user with email "test@example.com" already exists
When I send a POST request to /api/auth/register with the same email
Then I should receive a 400 Bad Request response
And the response should contain an error message about duplicate email
```

**Scenario 2: Login with invalid credentials**
```
Given I have a non-existent email or wrong password
When I send a POST request to /api/auth/login
Then I should receive a 401 Unauthorized response
And the response should contain a generic error message
```

**Scenario 3: Get non-existent user**
```
Given no user exists with ID 99999
When I send a GET request to /api/users/99999
Then I should receive a 404 Not Found response
```

### User Story 5: MCP Playwright Integration

**As a** QA engineer
**I want** MCP Playwright integration for API testing
**So that** I can leverage MCP automation capabilities

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario 1: MCP server configured**
```
Given I have MCP Playwright installed
When I configure the MCP server for this project
Then the configuration should be saved in project root
And MCP should be able to run Playwright API tests
```

**Scenario 2: Run tests via MCP**
```
Given MCP is configured
When I trigger API tests via MCP
Then tests should execute successfully
And results should be available in MCP format
```
