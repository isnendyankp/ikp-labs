# Frontend Authentication Flow with Home Page

**Status:** IN PROGRESS

**Plan Type:** Feature Implementation

**Priority:** High

## Overview

This plan implements a complete frontend authentication flow that protects the home page route and provides token-based session management. Users who successfully login or register will be redirected to a protected /home page, while unauthorized users attempting to access /home will be redirected back to /login.

## Key Features

- Protected home page route (/home, NOT /dashboard)
- Token storage using localStorage (NOT sessionStorage or cookies)
- Route guards and redirects for authentication
- User profile display on home page
- Logout functionality
- Token persistence across browser refreshes
- Comprehensive E2E and API testing
- Gherkin specifications for behavior documentation

## Scope

This implementation includes:
- Home page component with user information display
- Authentication context for state management
- Route protection middleware
- Redirect logic for authenticated/unauthenticated users
- Logout functionality with token cleanup
- Complete test coverage (E2E and API tests)
- Gherkin specifications

## Non-Scope

This implementation does NOT include:
- Dashboard page (explicitly using /home instead)
- Session storage or cookie-based authentication
- Token refresh mechanisms
- OAuth/Social login integration on home page
- Profile editing functionality
- Password change on home page
- User settings page

1. [Requirements](./requirements.md) - Detailed scope, user stories, and acceptance criteria
2. [Technical Design](./technical-design.md) - Architecture, implementation approach, and code structure
3. [Checklist](./checklist.md) - Implementation tasks, testing requirements, and validation steps

## Success Criteria

- Users can login and be redirected to /home with their profile displayed
- Users can register and be redirected to /home with their profile displayed
- Unauthenticated users accessing /home are redirected to /login
- Authenticated users accessing /login or /register are redirected to /home
- Users can logout and token is removed from localStorage
- Token persists across page refreshes
- All E2E tests pass
- All API tests pass
- All Gherkin specifications are implemented

- Frontend Login Form (completed)
- Frontend Registration Form (completed)

## Notes

- This plan follows the 9-commit structure over 3 implementation days
- Token storage uses localStorage for persistence
- Route is /home (NOT /dashboard) as specified
- All commits should be file-by-file for clarity
