## Phase 3: High Priority — Skills (Part A: Repo Skills)

> Split into 4 sub-phases (1 PR each) for easier revert if needed.

---

## Phase 3a: Plan Update (this PR)

### Overlap evaluation — COMPLETED

- [x] Read `.claude/skills/wow-criticality-assessment/SKILL.md`
- [x] Read `repo-assessing-criticality-confidence/SKILL.md` from senior repo (`wahidyankf/ose-public`)
- [x] Decision: **ADDITIVE** — adopt from senior repo, adapt to IKP-Labs

**Rationale:** Senior repo does NOT have `wow-criticality-assessment` — they only use
`repo-assessing-criticality-confidence`. Our `wow-criticality-assessment` covers the basics
but the senior version is significantly richer: P0–P4 priority matrix, execution order for
fixers, dual-label pattern, domain-specific examples framework. The senior version is the
canonical reference; we adopt and adapt it to IKP-Labs context (remove OSE/ayokoding
domain examples, replace with IKP-Labs domains).

### repo-applying-maker-checker-fixer

- [x] Create `.claude/skills/repo-applying-maker-checker-fixer/SKILL.md`
- [x] Defines MCF roles: maker (create), checker (validate), fixer (correct)
- [x] Decision guide: when a triad is needed vs. a single agent
- [x] References existing triads as examples
- [x] IKP-Labs naming convention: `<domain>-<maker|checker|fixer>.md`

> Completed in Phase 2c (bundled with repo-setup-manager, PR #159)

**Acceptance Criteria — Phase 3a:**

- [x] Overlap evaluation completed and documented
- [x] Decision rationale recorded in checklist
- [x] Commit: `docs(plan): update phase 3 — overlap decision and sub-phase split`

---

## Phase 3b: grill-me skill

- [x] Create `.claude/skills/grill-me/SKILL.md`
- [x] Defines relentless Q&A format: one question at a time, 2–4 options each, recommended option marked
- [x] Includes IKP-Labs context (plan scope, agent design, skill dependency, commit strategy)

**Acceptance Criteria — Phase 3b:**

- [x] SKILL.md has H1 title, category/purpose block, overview, substantive content, last-updated footer

> This phase assumes a dedicated educational content app (e.g. `apps/ayokoding-web/`) that
> consumes high-volume tutorial content. IKP-Labs does not have such an app — only
> `kameravue-fe` and `kameravue-be`. General tutorial docs in `docs/tutorials/` can be
> handled by the existing `documentation-writer` agent.
> Revisit if IKP-Labs ever adds an educational content app.
