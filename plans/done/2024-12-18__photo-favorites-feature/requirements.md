## Feature Overview

### Problem Statement

Users can currently like photos to show appreciation (public engagement), but there is **no way to privately save photos for later viewing**. This limits the ability to build personal collections and organize content they want to revisit.

**Current State:**
- ✅ Users can like photos (public appreciation)
- ❌ No way to privately bookmark photos
- ❌ No personal collection management
- ❌ Cannot save own photos to favorites
- ❌ No quick access to saved content

**Desired State:**
- ✅ Users can favorite any photo (public or own)
- ✅ Users can unfavorite photos
- ✅ Users can view all their favorited photos
- ✅ Favorites are private (only user can see)
- ✅ Works alongside Likes feature

---

### Solution Summary

Implement a **Photo Favorites system** that allows authenticated users to:
1. **Favorite** any photo they have access to
2. **Unfavorite** photos they've previously saved
3. **View** a dedicated "Favorited Photos" page showing all their saved photos
4. **Private collection** - only the user can see their favorites
5. **Experience instant feedback** through optimistic UI updates

**Key Benefits:**
- 🔖 Personal bookmarking system
- 📂 Content organization for later
- 🔒 Private collection (unlike Likes which are public)
- ⚡ Quick access to saved content
- 💡 Can favorite own photos for portfolio/showcase

---

  - Likes = **Public** appreciation (everyone sees count)
  - **Both can coexist** on same photo!
  - This week: **Favorites only**

- **Privacy Model:**
  - Favorites are 100% private
  - No one else can see what you favorited
  - No favorite counter visible to others
  - Your own favorite status not visible to others

- **Photo Access:**
  - Can favorite any photo you can view
  - Can favorite your own photos
  - Can favorite public photos
  - **Can favorite private photos IF you're the owner**

- **Authentication Required:**
  - Must be logged in to favorite
  - Unauthenticated users cannot favorite
  - Favorites tied to user account

**And** the favorite button should show as filled star
**And** the photo should appear in my Favorited Photos page

---

### User Story 2: Unfavorite a Photo

**As a** registered user
**I want to** unfavorite a photo I previously saved
**So that I** can clean up my collection or change my mind

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- ✅ When I click the filled star, it becomes outline (unfavorite)
- ✅ The photo is removed from my "Favorited Photos" collection
- ✅ I can favorite the photo again later
- ✅ Unfavoriting is instant with optimistic update

**Given** I am a logged-in user
**And** I am viewing a photo I have favorited
**When** I click the favorite button
**Then** the photo should be unmarked as favorited
**And** the favorite button should show as outline
**And** the photo should be removed from my collection

---

### User Story 3: View Favorited Photos

**As a** registered user
**I want to** see all photos I've favorited in one place
**So that I** can easily access my saved content

- ✅ **Only I can see my favorited photos** (private)

**Given** I am a logged-in user
**And** I have favorited multiple photos
**When** I navigate to "Favorited Photos" page
**Then** I should see all photos I've favorited
**And** they should be ordered by most recently favorited first
**And** no one else can see this list

---

### User Story 4: Private Favorites

**As a** registered user

**And** if the API fails, the UI should revert

---

### User Story 7: Works Alongside Likes

**As a** registered user
**I want to** both like AND favorite the same photo

---

## Assumptions

### Business Assumptions

1. **Favorites = Private Bookmarks**
   - Assumption: Favorites are 100% private (not visible to others)
   - Risk: Users expect social sharing? (Low - clear documentation)

2. **One Favorite Per User Per Photo**
   - Assumption: Users cannot "super favorite" or give multiple favorites
   - Risk: Users expect weighted favorites? (Low - standard pattern)

3. **Can Favorite Own Photos**
   - Assumption: Users want to organize their own portfolio
   - Risk: Confusion with Likes? (Low - clear UI distinction)

4. **No Favorite Counter**
   - Assumption: Favorites are private, no need for counter
   - Risk: Users expect to see popularity? (Low - use Likes for that)

---

### Technical Assumptions

1. **Database Performance**
   - Assumption: Indexes on photo_id and user_id provide good performance
   - Validation: Test with 10,000+ favorites

2. **Optimistic Updates**
   - Assumption: Network latency is acceptable for optimistic pattern
   - Validation: Test on slow 3G connection

3. **Privacy Enforcement**
   - Assumption: API-level privacy is sufficient (no frontend leaks)
   - Validation: Security testing & code review

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Duplicate Favorites (Database Race Condition)

**Risk:** Two simultaneous favorite requests create duplicate records
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High (data integrity)

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Database unique constraint on (photo_id, user_id)
- ✅ API returns 409 Conflict if duplicate
- ✅ Frontend disables button during API call
- ✅ Test concurrent requests in integration tests

---

### Risk 2: Privacy Leakage

**Risk:** Favorites accidentally exposed to other users
**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** High (privacy breach)

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Privacy enforced at API controller level
- ✅ No public endpoints for favorite counts
- ✅ Security testing for all endpoints
- ✅ Code review focused on privacy

---

### Risk 3: Confusion with Likes

**Risk:** Users confused about difference between Likes and Favorites
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium (UX confusion)

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Clear visual distinction (heart vs star)
- ✅ Tooltips explaining difference
- ✅ Documentation in UI
- ✅ User education in onboarding

---

### Risk 4: Performance with Many Favorites

**Risk:** Favorited Photos page slow with 1000+ favorited photos
**Probability:** Low (most users < 100 favorites)
**Impact:** Medium (slow page load)

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Pagination (12 per page) prevents loading all at once
- ✅ Database indexes on photo_favorites.user_id
- ✅ Lazy loading images
- ✅ Performance test with 1000+ favorites

---
