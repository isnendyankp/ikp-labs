## Feature Overview

### Problem Statement

Users can currently upload, view, edit, and delete photos in the gallery, but there is **no way to express appreciation** for photos they enjoy or **save interesting photos for later**. This limits user engagement and prevents building a sense of community around shared photos.

**Current State:**
- ❌ No way to show appreciation for photos
- ❌ No way to bookmark interesting photos
- ❌ No engagement metrics for photo owners
- ❌ No social interaction features

**Desired State:**
- ✅ Users can like photos they enjoy
- ✅ Users can unlike photos
- ✅ Users can see how many likes a photo has
- ✅ Users can view all photos they've liked
- ✅ Photo owners can see engagement on their photos

---

### Solution Summary

Implement a **Photo Likes system** that allows authenticated users to:
1. **Like** any public photo with a single click
2. **Unlike** photos they've previously liked
3. **View** a dedicated "Liked Photos" page showing all photos they've liked
4. **See like counts** on photo cards and detail pages
5. **Experience instant feedback** through optimistic UI updates

**Key Benefits:**
- 🎯 Increased user engagement
- 💬 Foundation for future social features (comments, follows)
- 📊 Engagement metrics for content creators
- 🔖 Personal collection of favorite content

---

### Out of Scope ❌

**NOT in Phase 1 (This Week):**
1. ❌ **Favorites/Bookmarks** - Different feature (next week)
2. ❌ **Photo Comments** - Separate feature (future)
3. ❌ **Like Notifications** - Requires email system (future)
4. ❌ **Who Liked This Photo** - List of users who liked (future)
5. ❌ **Unlike from Liked Photos Page** - Can only unlike from photo card/detail
6. ❌ **Sort by Most Liked** - Gallery sorting enhancement (future)
7. ❌ **Like Own Photos** - Users cannot like their own photos (business rule)

**Deferred to Future Phases:**
- Photo Favorites (Phase 2 - Next week)
- Real-time like updates via WebSocket (Phase 3 - Future)
- Like activity feed (Phase 4 - Future)
- Analytics dashboard (Phase 5 - Future)

---

### Scope Boundaries

**Clear Boundaries:**
- **Likes vs Favorites:**
  - Likes = Public appreciation (visible to others)
  - Favorites = Private bookmarks (only you see)
  - This week: **Likes only**

- **Public Photos Only:**
  - Users can only like public photos
  - Private photos cannot be liked
  - Own photos cannot be liked

- **Authentication Required:**
  - Must be logged in to like
  - Unauthenticated users can see like counts but cannot like

---

## User Stories

### Epic: Photo Likes System

**As a** registered user
**I want to** like photos I enjoy
**So that I** can show appreciation and save interesting content

---

### User Story 1: Like a Photo

**As a** registered user
**I want to** like a public photo
**So that I** can show appreciation for content I enjoy

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ When viewing a photo (gallery or detail), I see a heart icon
- ✅ When I click the heart icon, it fills in (visual feedback)
- ✅ The like count increases by 1 immediately
- ✅ The photo is saved to my "Liked Photos" collection
- ✅ I cannot like the same photo twice
- ✅ I cannot like my own photos
- ✅ I can only like public photos

**Given** I am a logged-in user
**And** I am viewing a public photo I haven't liked
**When** I click the like button
**Then** the photo should be marked as liked
**And** the like count should increase by 1
**And** the like button should show as filled

---

### User Story 2: Unlike a Photo

**As a** registered user
**I want to** unlike a photo I previously liked
**So that I** can change my mind or clean up my collection

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ When viewing a photo I've liked, the heart icon is filled
- ✅ When I click the filled heart, it becomes outline (unlike)
- ✅ The like count decreases by 1 immediately
- ✅ The photo is removed from my "Liked Photos" collection
- ✅ I can like the photo again later

**Given** I am a logged-in user
**And** I am viewing a photo I have liked
**When** I click the like button
**Then** the photo should be unmarked as liked
**And** the like count should decrease by 1
**And** the like button should show as outline

---

### User Story 3: View Liked Photos

**As a** registered user
**I want to** see all photos I've liked in one place
**So that I** can revisit content I enjoyed

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ I can navigate to "Liked Photos" page from main menu
- ✅ The page shows all photos I've liked, newest first
- ✅ Photos display in same grid layout as gallery
- ✅ I can see photo title, description, and like count
- ✅ Pagination works (12 photos per page)
- ✅ I can click a photo to view details
- ✅ If I haven't liked any photos, I see a helpful empty state

**Given** I am a logged-in user
**And** I have liked multiple photos
**When** I navigate to "Liked Photos" page
**Then** I should see all photos I've liked
**And** they should be ordered by most recently liked first

---

### User Story 4: See Like Count

**As a** any user (logged in or not)
**I want to** see how many likes a photo has
**So that I** can gauge its popularity

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Like count displays on photo cards in gallery
- ✅ Like count displays on photo detail page
- ✅ Count updates immediately when I like/unlike
- ✅ Count is accurate (matches database)
- ✅ "0 likes" shows as "0" (not hidden)

**Given** I am viewing a photo
**When** the page loads
**Then** I should see the current like count
**And** the count should reflect the total number of users who liked it

---

### User Story 5: Optimistic UI Updates

**As a** registered user
**I want** instant feedback when I like/unlike
**So that** the app feels fast and responsive

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ When I click like, UI updates immediately (no loading spinner)
- ✅ Like count increases before API confirms
- ✅ If API fails, UI rolls back to previous state
- ✅ Error message shows if like fails
- ✅ Retry option available on failure

**Given** I am a logged-in user
**When** I click the like button
**Then** the UI should update instantly
**And** the API request should happen in the background
**And** if the API fails, the UI should revert

---

## Assumptions

### Business Assumptions

1. **Like = Public Appreciation**
   - Assumption: Likes are visible to all users (public metric)
   - Risk: Privacy concerns? (Low - social norm)

2. **One Like Per User Per Photo**
   - Assumption: Users cannot "super like" or give multiple likes
   - Risk: Users expect weighted likes? (Low - standard pattern)

3. **No Undo After Unlike**
   - Assumption: Unlike is permanent (no "are you sure?" dialog)
   - Risk: Accidental unlikes? (Low - can re-like immediately)

4. **Public Photos Only**
   - Assumption: Private photos cannot be liked
   - Risk: Users expect to like private photos in shared albums? (Low - not implemented yet)

---

### Technical Assumptions

1. **Database Performance**
   - Assumption: Indexes on photo_id and user_id provide good performance
   - Validation: Test with 10,000+ likes

2. **Optimistic Updates**
   - Assumption: Network latency is acceptable for optimistic pattern
   - Validation: Test on slow 3G connection

3. **JWT Token Validity**
   - Assumption: Token is valid for entire session
   - Validation: Handle token expiration gracefully

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Duplicate Likes (Database Race Condition)

**Risk:** Two simultaneous like requests create duplicate records
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High (data integrity)

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Database unique constraint on (photo_id, user_id)
- ✅ API returns 409 Conflict if duplicate
- ✅ Frontend disables button during API call
- ✅ Test concurrent requests in integration tests

---

### Risk 2: Optimistic Update Rollback UX

**Risk:** Failed API causes confusing UI state changes
**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** Medium (user confusion)

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Clear error toast with "Failed to like. Please try again."
- ✅ UI smoothly reverts to previous state
- ✅ Retry button in error toast
- ✅ Test network failures in E2E tests

---

### Risk 3: Performance with Many Likes

**Risk:** Liked Photos page slow with 1000+ liked photos
**Probability:** Low (most users < 100 likes)
**Impact:** Medium (slow page load)

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Pagination (12 per page) prevents loading all at once
- ✅ Database indexes on photo_likes.user_id
- ✅ Lazy loading images
- ✅ Performance test with 1000+ likes

---

### Risk 4: Scope Creep

**Risk:** Adding Favorites, Comments, etc. during implementation
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High (missed deadline)

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Clear scope document (this file!)
- ✅ Defer all "nice to have" features
- ✅ Focus on 32 tests passing
- ✅ Daily checklist keeps focus
